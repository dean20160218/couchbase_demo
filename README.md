# couchbase_demo
A simple webapi (RESTful service) written in C#/.NET Core 2.0 using couchbase. It was written on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux machine, but Linux *is not* required. However, you will need a Couchbase instance running, and this particular demo uses a Couchbase demo database running in a local (i.e. localhost:8091) Linux container.
